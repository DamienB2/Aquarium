# Aquarium Project

The Aquarium project involves creating simulation of an aquarium containing several species of fish (each with a particular behaviour), a variable environment and consumables with different consumables with different effects on the fish.
For this simulation to be realistic, we need to create several different fish, each with a specific purpose.

‎ 

‎ 

The **Orangefish** is a "basic".

The aim of this fish is to move in the same direction until it hits one of the scenery elements or one of the edges of the aquarium.
When it collision, it changes direction. A new target will be randomly determined on one of the other edges of the aquarium.

‎ 

‎ 

The **Redfish** is a predatory fish.

The most intelligent of all, it hunts other fish. Its aim is to eat all the fish of a different other than its own. 
They move from fish to fish, changing direction changing direction when it finds a prey that is closer than the previous one. 
Redfish are stimulated by the temperature of the aquarium. the warmer the water, the faster they move.

‎ 

‎ 

The **Bluefish** are sociable fish.

They like to be close to others. Its aim is to stay as close as possible to fish of its own colour or to purple mauve fish, even if it means dying.

‎ 

‎ 

The **Mauvefish** is a cowardly fish.

It's afraid of being eaten by the Redfish. Its aim is to get as far away from them as possible. 
They also like decorations. The more decorations there are in the aquarium, the faster the purple fish moves.

‎ 

‎ 

There are also **decorations** and some bonuses in the aquarium.

The decorations are green rectangles that prevent the fish from getting through. 
They appear randomly and there is a maximum of five in the aquarium.

‎ 

‎ 

Finally, there are 2 bonuses. **Insects** and **pellets**

- Insects allow the fish they are eaten by to have a temporary 
temporary increase in speed.

- When eaten by a fish of a particular species, pellets can 
of one species, stop all other species for 10 seconds.
